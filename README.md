## FASTATOOLS

Bioinformatics is about creating softwares that cope with biology issues.
A classic issue consists in collecting genetic sequences (DeoxyriboNucleic Acid, DNA), and extracting as
much information as possible, such as genes or coded proteins.
The goal of this project is to develop a library in order to compute basic DNA analyses.

DNA is a molecule found in the cells of living beings.
Parents transmit DNA to their progeny and, thanks to successive mutations, it is responsible for evolution;
reading, decoding and understanding DNA leads to living beings understanding.

DNA is composed of 4 molecules: Adenine (A), Cytosine (C), Guanine (G) and Thymine (T).
Thus, DNA is often regarded as a string (called sequence), representing the sequency of those molecules.
